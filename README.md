The EmployeeLoginInfo table has the information needed to log into the EmployeeLogin form.

All forms can be access through the navigation bar.

For access to VBA code, open the desired form, right click, enter design view, select desired button, combobox, or textbox, go to properties, then event. Some will have a on click event, some will have a after update event.
